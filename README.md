Pixabay search API page

Netifly page: https://pixabay-react-fdr.netlify.app/

This page its the regular page were its consume an API and shows the information on your page, this time like cards with a link to a big picture.

I build it with react and a few hooks, like useState and useEffect.

From css i use Bootswatch (boostrap modificator).

P/D: the chalenging part it was cards sizes. Because you never know the size of a picture you are going to recive, so i avoid transform height or width, so that way i canÂ´t pixel the image ;)
